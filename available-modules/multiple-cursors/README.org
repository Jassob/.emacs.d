* About this file
  This file contains the literate source of the Multiple-cursors module.

* Module
   When one has gotten used to multiple cursors it is hard to live
   without. Luckily there exists an aptly named package that solves
   this use case.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle module.el
     (use-package multiple-cursors :ensure t
       :init
       ;; Unset to make mc/add-cursor-on-click listen to its binding
       (global-unset-key (kbd "M-<down-mouse-1>"))
       :bind (("C-S-c C-S-c" . mc/edit-lines)
              ("C->" . mc/mark-next-like-this)
              ("C-<" . mc/mark-previous-like-this)
              ("C-c C->" . mc/mark-all-like-this)
              ("C-," . mc/mark-pop)
              ("M-<mouse-1>" . mc/add-cursor-on-click)))
   #+end_src

   This sets the following keybindings:

   - =C->= for the next word
   - =C-<= for the previous
   - =C-c C->= for all words
   - =C-,= places a cursor on the point and pops the mark stack
   - =M-<mouse-1>= adds new cursor on mouse pointer

   It also unsets the (for me) mysteric M-mouse1 key bindings.
