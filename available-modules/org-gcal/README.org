* About this file
  This file contains the literate source of the Org-gcal module.

* Module
** Access Google Calendar

   Even though I use =org-mode= for scheduling a lot of tasks and
   other stuff I also use Google Calendar to organize stuff together
   with other people, this section is about how I make these two work
   together.

       :config

	     (eval (read-from-file (no-littering-expand-var-file-name "org/gcal/file-alist.el")))))
