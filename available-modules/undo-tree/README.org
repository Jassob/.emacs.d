* About this file
  This file contains the literate source of the Undo-tree module.

* Module
   I find Emacs default undo behaviour rather intuitive (of course a
   redo is just an undo of your last undo!), but I like being able to
   visualise the timeline of my file. Enters =undo-tree-mode=!

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle module.el
      (use-package undo-tree
        :ensure t :diminish t
        :config
        (global-undo-tree-mode)
        (setq undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t)
        (setq undo-tree-visualizer-diff t))
   #+end_src
