* About this file
  This file contains the literate source of the Weechat module.

* Module
  I use weechat for communicating over IRC because of it's relay
  or http://glowing-bear.org to access my chat session.
  features. Weechat relays enable me to use a good enough Android app,

  In the future I might get around to fix my znc (a IRC bouncer) setup
  and will thus not need to use a separate chat protocol besides IRC,
  but until then I stick with weechat.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle module.el
    (use-package weechat :commands (weechat-connect)
      :init (defvar weechat--auth-file (concat etc-dir "weechat-auth-file"))
      :config
      (local--init-file-if-missing weechat--auth-file
                                   #'weechat--prompt-for-auth)
      (setq weechat-color-list '(unspecified "black" "dark gray" "dark red"
                                             "red" "dark green" "light green"
                                             "brown" "yellow" "deepskyblue3"
                                             "light blue" "dark magenta"
                                             "magenta" "dark cyan" "light cyan"
                                             "gray" "white")
            weechat-modules '(weechat-button weechat-complete weechat-notifications)
            weechat-password-callback #'weechat--get-password)
      (add-hook 'weechat-connect-hook 'weechat-monitor-all-buffers))

    (defun weechat--get-password (host port)
      "Get the stored password from a credentials file.
    The credentials file should store an alist in the form ((HOST
    . PORT) . PASSWORD)."
      (if (file-exists-p weechat--auth-file)
          (let ((passwd-alist (read-from-file weechat--auth-file)))
            (cdr (assoc (cons host port) passwd-alist)))
        (warn "Weechat auth file does not exist, can not auto-connect.")))
  #+end_src

  To simplify the customization of =weechat= credentials I've created
  this function to create the =weechat-auth-file= in the correct
  format.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle module.el
    (defun weechat--prompt-for-auth ()
      "Store the weechat credentials in =etc-dir/weechat-auth-file.el=."
      (let ((host (read-from-minibuffer "Host: ")))
        (let ((port (string-to-int (read-from-minibuffer "Port: "))))
          (let ((password (read-passwd "Password: ")))
            (cons (cons host port) password)))))

    (defun weechat--update-auth-info ()
      "Updates the weechat authentication file with information from
    the user."
      (interactive)
      (local--update-alist-file weechat--auth-file
                                (weechat--prompt-for-auth)))
  #+end_src
