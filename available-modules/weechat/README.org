* About this file
  This file contains the literate source of the Weechat module.

* Module
  Weechat is a IRC and general chat application and protocol. Thanks
  to the [[https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack/][wee-slack]] plugin it can also act as a Slack client, which
  means that I can read all Slack messages in a less resource-heavy
  client.
