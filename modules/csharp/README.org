* About this file
  This file contains the literate source of the C# module.

* Module
  During my internship at Ascom I coded a lot of C# and .NET which of
  course made me use Visual Studio which is, considering that it is
  an IDE, not that frustrating. I missed my keybindings and all
  custom stuff that I can use on Emacs so I went out looking for
  packages that enabled the same kind of tooling that I found helpful
  in VS. I found [[http://www.omnisharp.net/][OmniSharp]] to be the package I was looking for and
  together with [[https://github.com/josteink/csharp-mode][csharp-mode]] they provide everything I need to code C#
  in Emacs, even though I still need to use VS to run tests and
  build.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle module.el
    (use-package csharp-mode :defer t
      :mode "\\.cs'"
      :config
      (add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook 'omnisharp-mode))

    (use-package omnisharp :defer t
      :config
      (when (eq system-type 'windows-nt)
        (setq-default omnisharp-server-executable-path
                      (concat include-dir "omnisharp/OmniSharp.exe")))
      :bind (:map csharp-mode-map
                  ("M-."   . omnisharp-find-implementations)
                  ("C-M-." . omnisharp-find-usages)))
